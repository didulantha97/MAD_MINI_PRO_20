There is an issue in GIT repository, One of our contributors is not listed in the Graph(Contributions to master, excluding merge commits).
This was occurred due to incompatibility between branches in the GIT repository and unable to merge the branch with Master. We tried to solve this issue from our end and we got the only solution is to insert the files manually to the Master Branch.
